        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my resume webpage.</p>
        <p>My name is Seth Templeton, I'm 20 years old and currently working on my Associates in Arts degree for digital media, in the hopes that I can someday work in
            the video game design scene. Designing and modeling truly are my passion, and it is in my utmost of interest to make it my job. My hopes are to someday put all the ideas 
            I have to use, and I see the video game format as the best way to do that, due to their interactive quality. My aspiration is something like Masahiro Ito, designing so many memorable characters and 
            settings, I like to think these ideas of mine have potential, I just need to get better at executing them. I've practiced my ideas through several mediums, to which I find sketching and then 3d modeling 
            my prefered method of expressing my ideas. </p>

        <h2>Software/Hardware</h2>
        <p>In my endeavors to better myself as an artist, I've become familiar with many softwares and even a small bit of hardware, these being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a computer and knowing the right optimizations </li>
            <li>Blender - I've modeled, textured, and rigged in</li>
            <li>Gimp - a 'free photoshop' I use for both editing images and making textures for Blender models</li>
            <li>Photoshop - I am familiar with it, albeit my use of gimp</li>
            <li>Krita - a program I use to sketch digitally</li>
            
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have no social media, at least in the regard of one for posting my works. I usually just share my art with friends. Ultimately this has opened my eyes fully that I should post my works somewhere, rather than treat my progress 
            as though I'm a hermit. If I were to make social media pages to share my art, to put them in a hierachy of what would be best for sharing, it'd probably go like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Twitter</li>
            <li>Instagram</li>
            <li>Youtube, just because it's better for posting video and music projects compared to the others.</li>
        </ol>
