        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my resume webpage.</p>
        <p>My name is Seth Templeton, I'm 20 years old and currently working on my Associates in Arts degree for digital media, in the hopes that I can someday work in
            the video game design scene. Designing and modeling truly are my passion, and it is in my utmost of interest to make it my job. My hopes are to someday put all the ideas 
            I have to use, and I see the video game format as the best way to do that, due to their interactive quality. My aspiration is something like Masahiro Ito, designing so many memorable characters and 
            settings, I like to think these ideas of mine have potential, I just need to get better at executing them. I've practiced my ideas through several mediums, to which I find sketching and then 3d modeling 
            my prefered method of expressing my ideas. </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>My skills are quite varying I would say, to which I'd describe my skills being:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creative</li>
            <li>Willing to learn</li>
            <li>Jack of Trades</li>
            <li>Charismatic</li>
            <li>User Interface Design</li>
            <li>Web Design</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Open to criticism</li>
            <li></li>

        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Software/Hardware</h2>
        <p>In my endeavors to better myself as an artist, I've become familiar with many softwares and even a small bit of hardware, these being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building a computer and knowing the right optimizations </li>
            <li>Blender - I've modeled, textured, and rigged in</li>
            <li>Gimp - a 'free photoshop' I use for both editing images and making textures for Blender models</li>
            <li>Photoshop - I am familiar with it, albeit my use of gimp</li>
            <li>Krita - a program I use to sketch digitally</li>
            
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, I have no social media, at least in the regard of one for posting my works. I usually just share my art with friends. Ultimately this has opened my eyes fully that I should post my works somewhere, rather than treat my progress 
            as though I'm a hermit. If I were to make social media pages to share my art, to put them in a hierachy of what would be best for sharing, it'd probably go like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Twitter</li>
            <li>Instagram</li>
            <li>Youtube, just because it's better for posting video and music projects compared to the others.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Pieces I've Made:</h2>
        <h3>Halloween, 2021 Piece</h3>
        <img src="Images/WorkA.png" alt="3D CandyCorn Man" height="540" width="540">
        <p>This was a peice I had made in 2021, specifcally for halloween. I wanted to practice on something simple, and candycorn is simple in both texture and shape.</p>
        
        <h3>Low-Poly Behelit</h3>
        <img src="Images/WorkB.png" alt="Red egg with a nose, closed eyes and a mouth rearranged">
        <p>A low poly 'Behelit' from the dark and brutal series 'Berserk, for this I decided to make to practice texturing.  I attempted to use real texures (The eyes and mouth), and cobbled them together in photoshop to use, matching the 
            coloration to the base layer, and healing/ smudging them to sink into the texture as if part of it.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Stress Doll</h3>
        <img src="Images/WorkC.png" alt="Squeezable Stress Doll" height="509" width="711">
        <p>A rather simple practice just to attempt making something I have in my desk into a 3d object. I felt like doing something more decoartive this one when I made it, so I cut it out and put it on a blue 
            background as well as giving it a shadow.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Catepillar Sketch</h3>
        <img src="Images/WorkD.jpg" alt="Worm/Catepillar with a somber face" height="550" width="800">
        <p>An umpromted sketch I had done, there was no reason behind this sketch. I was thinking about the sound of stomping sounds a large catepillar would make and just gave it more human face. I feel like it has 
            potential, seeing it again males me want to attempt to give it colors, a background, a finer outline, but for now it's just a sketch.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Low-Poly Gromit Mug</h3>
        <img src="Images/WorkE.png" alt="A mug of Gromit from 'Wallace and Gromit'" >
        <p>Another practice I did of an object on my desk to 3d, I used my Gromit Mug for reference. The mug is more a novelty than anything, a coveted relic I'm scared to somehow break due it its 
            fragile structure.
